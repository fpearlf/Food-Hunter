# Food-Hunter
1- This is an online platform  created with php, mysql ,Html , css , where different restaurant owners come together, upload their menu and customers get to order what ever food they wish to eat, and the different restaurants managers concerned  will process the food delivery.

2-It can be imported to your localhost(phpMyAdmin) or any other servers. Also configure the "connection.php" to set up the necessary connections with the database.
More features such as seting up delivery points and payment intergrations are yet to be developed and implemented.

3-The Food-Hunter is a school project done by Forcha Pearl and Tawah Peggy
